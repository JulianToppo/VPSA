    <Typography>
      {`Valorant exists as an ever-evolving battleground, where each match is a canvas for strategic brilliance, teamwork, and individual prowess. Within this intricate 
      tapestry, the role of a pocket Sage transcends mere in-game mechanics; it embodies the very essence of support, mentorship, and tactical acumen. These players are 
      not just gunners; they are orchestrators of victory, guiding their teams through complex tactical scenarios. For them, success hinges not only on precise aiming 
      but also on a profound understanding of the game's mechanics, strategy, and psychology. This is precisely where certification programs for Valorant pocket Sages 
      step into the limelight, offering a structured pathway to excellence.`}

      {`Certification programs aren't just a matter of acquiring a badge or a title; they represent an unwavering commitment to professionalism and accountability 
      within the Valorant community. In an arena where competition is nothing short of fierce and every player's contribution has far-reaching consequences, it becomes 
      imperative to ensure that those who shoulder the mantle of a pocket Sage are not just adept at aiming and shooting but also steeped in the virtues of ethics and 
      responsibility. These programs function as beacons of enlightenment, guiding aspiring pocket Sages through a rigorous curriculum that not only refines their 
      in-game skills but also molds them into upstanding members of the gaming fraternity.`}

      clear-cut standards of proficiency and ethical conduct, these programs act as formidable bulwarks against the treacherous pitfalls that unqualified or unethical 
      practitioners can present. Imagine, for a moment, a team that entrusts its destiny to a pocket Sage, only to discover that their guidance is misinformed or, worse 
      yet, maliciously motivated. Certification programs are the custodians of fairness, protecting teams from such calamities and preserving the very essence of 
      sportsmanship that underpins competitive gaming.`}

      and tactics that can spell the difference between victory and defeat. Yet, it's not just about their tactical prowess; it's about the intangible quality of leadership 
      and teamwork they bring to the table. Teams experience not only a surge in strategic insights but also an upswing in cohesion and coordination, leading to an overall 
      elevation in the quality of matches.`}
